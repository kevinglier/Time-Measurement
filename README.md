# Time-Measurement

This is a little collection of online tools which may help to measure time 
in different conditions. 

It contains (checked checkboxes means its really in there, otherwise it is a todo):

  - [x] A countdown with the possibility make notes which are logged with a timestamp. The timespan of the timer get be set to pomodoro, hour, or any wanted value.
  - [ ] A time log which does not count down at all but gives you the ability to write little log entries. They get a time stamp automatically and a difference in minutes from the previous time log entry. This way you can write a log and then calculate what ever you wish to calculate.
  - [ ] The same time log but with the ability to set a category on each line. At the end of the log all categories are summarized.
  - [ ] Persist the time table in the Local Storage of the browser, so that a refresh or crash of the browser won't remove all the notes.
  - [ ] Process the notes in a template
